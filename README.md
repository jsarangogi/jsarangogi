<b>Let's talk a little bit of me 👓</b>

Hi, my name is Juan Santiago Arango. I'm a software developer with +7 years of experience developing web applications using Java and Spring Framework, recently I've been using Java in your 17 version and Quarkus framework with Mutiny for reactive programming.

I'm passionate about coding, facing and solving challenges always under the best practices of coding. I have middle knowledge about clean, onion, and hexagonal architectures, coding principles such as SOLID, KISS, and YAGNI, design patterns such as DDD, CQRS, Event-Driven, SAGA, and Outbox, or circuit breakers such as Hystrix, messaging queues services such as Kafka, RabbitMQ or AWS SNS.
